# Real-Time LPG Gas & Flame Detection System 

This repository contains the design and implementation of a **real-time LPG gas and flame detection system** using MQ2 and flame sensors, a National Instruments DAQ card, and LabVIEW for data acquisition and processing. The project integrates **Python scripts** via LabVIEW Python nodes and features a custom-built **web dashboard** for live monitoring.

## Project Overview
- **Sensors Used:** MQ2 (LPG/Smoke detection), Flame sensor  
- **DAQ:** National Instruments DAQ card  
- **Software:** LabVIEW (for real-time acquisition & processing)  
- **Integration:** LabVIEW Python nodes for seamless data handling  
- **Dashboard:** Custom web interface built with HTML, CSS, and Python

##  Features
- Real-time monitoring of **LPG gas concentration**  
- **Flame detection** with instant alerting  
- **Python integration in LabVIEW** for advanced processing  
- Web dashboard displaying:
  - Gas levels
  - Flame alerts
  - Estimated gas refill timing
